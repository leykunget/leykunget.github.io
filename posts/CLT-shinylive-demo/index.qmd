This interactive Shiny app demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) using a dynamic histogram. The CLT states that the distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the original distribution, given a sufficiently large sample size.

This visualization helps in understanding how the sample mean converges to a normal distribution as the number of samples increases.

The app is built using the `shiny` and `shinylive` r packages.
