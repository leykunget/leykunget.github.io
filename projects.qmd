The Ethiopia Earthquake Tracker is a real-time web application I developed to monitor seismic activities across Ethiopia, built using **R Shiny**. With Ethiopia recently experiencing a series of earthquakes of varying magnitudes, this tool has become more essential than ever.

**Key Features:**

âœ¨ Live tracking of earthquakes using USGS (United States Geological Survey) data  
âœ¨ Interactive map visualization  
âœ¨ Real-time statistics and updates  
âœ¨ Time-based filtering options  
âœ¨ Magnitude Range Selection  
âœ¨ Automatic 5-minute data refresh  

The app serves as a valuable tool for monitoring seismic activity in Ethiopia, providing both researchers and the general public with easy access to earthquake data through an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

The Childhood Micronutrient Deficiency Prediction App is an interactive tool built with **R Shiny** that predicts childhood micronutrient deficiency. This application predicts childhood micronutrient deficiency using machine learning. It employs an **XGBoost** model trained on various demographic and health-related features. The model was developed using the **tidymodels** framework and demonstrates good predictive performance. Furthermore, the model has been deployed to ensure accessibility and ease of use for healthcare providers and researchers.

The interactive spatial map showed that the spatial variation of childhood **micronutrient (MN) deficiency** in Ethiopia was most prevalent in the Somali, Afar, and Amhara regions, while the Gambela, Addis Ababa, and Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples (SNNP) regions had the lowest prevalence of MN deficiency.[Link](https://leykungetaneh.quarto.pub/spatial-distribution-of-childhood-mn-deficiency/)
