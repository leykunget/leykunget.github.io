    "text": "This interactive Shiny app demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) using a dynamic histogram. The CLT states that the distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the original distribution, given a sufficiently large sample size.\nThis visualization helps in understanding how the sample mean converges to a normal distribution as the number of samples increases.\nThe app is built using the shiny and shinylive r packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPlease wait a few seconds to see the App!\n\n\n#| standalone: true\n#| viewerHeight: 600\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(bslib)\n\ntheme &lt;- bs_theme(font_scale = 1.5)\n\n# Define UI for app that draws a histogram ----\nui &lt;- page_sidebar(theme = theme,\n  sidebar = sidebar(open = \"open\",\n    numericInput(\"n\", \"Sample size\", 100),\n    checkboxInput(\"pause\", \"Pause\", FALSE),\n  ),\n  plotOutput(\"plot\", width=1100)\n)\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n  data &lt;- reactive({\n    input$resample\n    if (!isTRUE(input$pause)) {\n      invalidateLater(1000)\n    }\n    rnorm(input$n)\n  })\n  \n  output$plot &lt;- renderPlot({\n    hist(data(),\n         breaks = 40,\n         xlim = c(-3, 3),\n         ylim = c(0, 0.5),\n         col = 'skyblue',\n         border = 'white',\n         xlab = \"Value\",\n         freq = FALSE,\n         main = \"Central Limit Theorem Demonstration\",\n         cex.lab = 1.2,\n         cex.axis = 1.1,\n         cex.main = 1.4\n    )\n    \n    x &lt;- seq(from = -3, to = 3, length.out = 500)\n    y &lt;- dnorm(x)\n    lines(x, y, lwd = 2, col = 'darkgreen')\n    \n    lwd &lt;- 3\n    abline(v = 0, col = \"red\", lwd = lwd, lty = 2)\n    abline(v = mean(data()), col = \"blue\", lwd = lwd, lty = 1)\n    \n    legend(\"topright\", legend = c(\"Normal Distribution\", \"Population Mean\", \"Sample Mean\"),\n           col = c(\"darkgreen\", \"red\", \"blue\"),\n           lty = c(1, 2, 1),\n           lwd = c(2, lwd, lwd),\n           bty = \"n\",\n           cex = 1.1,\n           text.font = 1.5\n    )\n    \n    grid(nx = NULL, ny = NULL, col = \"lightgray\", lty = \"dotted\")\n  }, res = 140)\n}\n\n# Create Shiny app ----\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)"
